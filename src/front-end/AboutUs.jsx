                                        cleaning service through Farenow, you
                                        are allowing a stranger to enter your
                                        home. When you book a house cleaner
                                        through the Farenow platform, you can

                                        cleaning that you prefer, you can easily
                                        let your house cleaner know ahead of
                                        time. You can even prioritize the

                                        Farenow professional will tackle in the

                                        Ignacio Leonhardt and Weina Scott were
                                        the first members of the founding team
                                        at Farenow. After spending 9 months
                                        working with Farenow, Ignacio moved back
                                        to Guatemala and is now running his
                                        family's business. Weina worked with
                                        Farenow for 7 months, building the first
                                        version of the website, and now works on
                                        another startup in California. Bob Davis
                                        and Jeremiah Daly from Highland Capital
                                        Partners invested the first capital in
                                        Farenow, followed by Joel Cutler and
                                        Nitesh Banta from General Catalyst
                                        Partners, David Tisch and Adam

                                        Papas. Andrew Lurvey was Farenow's first
                                        operations team member. Andrew joined
                                        Farenow when we were four people in a
                                        small room. He spent two years working
                                        with Farenow while we've grown to over
                                        200 hundred people in 28 cities.
